# Spring Framework 

This repository contains my learning journey through the Spring Framework. I have explored various fundamental concepts and features of Spring, including coupling, annotations, the Spring container, POJO, dependency injections, Jakarta EE annotations and specifications, and XML configuration.

## Topics Covered

1. **Coupling**
    - Understanding loose and tight coupling.
    - Benefits of loose coupling in software design.

2. **Annotations**
    - Overview of different Spring annotations.
    - Usage and examples of key annotations like `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`, `@Autowired`, etc.

3. **Spring Container (IoC Container)**
    - Introduction to the Inversion of Control (IoC) principle.
    - Understanding Spring Container or Spring Context.
    - Different types of containers in Spring.

4. **POJO (Plain Old Java Object)**
    - Definition and use of POJOs in Spring.
    - Role of POJOs in Spring-based applications.

5. **Dependency Injection (DI)**
    - Concept of Dependency Injection.
    - Types of Dependency Injection:
        - Constructor Injection
        - Setter Injection
        - Field Injection

6. **Jakarta EE**
    - Overview of Jakarta EE and its relevance to Spring.
    - Key Jakarta EE annotations and specifications.

7. **XML Configuration**
    - Configuring Spring beans using XML.
    - Examples of XML-based configuration.
